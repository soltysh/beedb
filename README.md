# BeeDB

BeeDB is an engine that allows creating lots of small, configurable databases, 
pretty much like bees inside the hive, thus the name, its main features are:

* allows creating basic data structures
* allows searching through the data
* provides online access to the data

# The idea

The idea was born earlier this year when I've struggled once again to have a list
of the books I read and I still want to read, the same for movies. I didn't want
to use any of the services available out there, because they provide you with much
more than than I really needed, mainly the whole social stuff. Having a kind of
todo list to track those didn't make sense either, as with time it'd grow too much
and searching through it would be painful. What's most important, I wanted to have
access to it no matter where I was. By that time I ended with some online sheet to
list those books and movies separately. But since then I've started to gather ideas
how to solve problems that other people like me might be having daily? How to solve
it with something simple but powerful? I've came up with this project.


# TODO list:

* the engine:
    * config - json, yaml, xml
    * db - MongoDB
    * fulltext search - Elasticsearch
* databased to be used MongoDB
* web:
    * API - Flask + REST
    * browser - Angular.js vs Ember.js vs.Backbone.js
                 (flex layout, bootstrap themes (agency))
    * mobile
